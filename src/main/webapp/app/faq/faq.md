## Is xEUR a 'virtual currency'? 

Yes, it is. 
According to §3(9) of Estonian [Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/518012019004/consolide/current) of 27th November 2017: 

> ‘virtual currency’ means a value represented in the digital form, which is digitally transferable, preservable or tradable and which natural persons or legal persons accept as a payment instrument, but that is not the legal tender of any country or funds for the purposes of Article 4(25) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (OJ L 337, 23.12.2015, pp. 35–127) or a payment transaction for the purposes of points (k) and (l) of Article 3 of the same Directive;

Since xEUR 1) represent value in the digital form, 2) is not a legal tender of any country, 3) is digitally transferable, preservable and tradable, and 4) can be used as a payment instrument, it is a "virtual currency".

## Is the sale of virtual currencies subject to value added tax? 

No. The Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled that the the exchange of traditional currency for units of the virtual currency and vice versa is exempt from VAT based on the ‘currency’ exemption: 

> Article 2(1)(c) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax must be interpreted as meaning that transactions such as those at issue in the main proceedings, which consist of the exchange of traditional currency for units of the ‘bitcoin’ virtual currency and vice versa, in return for payment of a sum equal to the difference between, on the one hand, the price paid by the operator to purchase the currency and, on the other hand, the price at which he sells that currency to his clients, constitute the supply of services for consideration within the meaning of that article

> "For the purposes of VAT, cryptocurrencies are considered as the same currency as euros, etc.  Thus, the usage of cryptocurrencies as remuneration is equal to the usage of legal tender and therefore out of the scope of VAT"

## Can you sell xEUR to US residents and is xEUR a security under US Law? 

Yes, we can sell to U.S. citizens, as far as they can make payment in EUR to our bank account. 

No, U.S. law is not applicable. 

No, xEUR is not a 'security' according to U.S. law. 

US Supreme Court created the "Howey Test" in [Securities and Exchange Commission v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946)](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/328/293.html), see also: http://consumer.findlaw.com/securities-law/what-is-the-howey-test.html

Under the Howey Test, a transaction is an investment contract if:

1) It is an investment of money.

2) There is an expectation of profits from the investment.

3) The investment of money is in a common enterprise.

4) Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party. 

Holder of xEUR tokens cannot get any income from this token. Price of one token is one euro, and it should not change. 
Holder of a token does not receive any dividends or income on this token. In fact, he even has to pay commission to exchange tokens back to fiat. 
Thus xEUR is clearly not a 'security' under the "Howey Test".

## Can I use xEUR on cryptocurrency exchanges? 

Yes. You can use xEUR on [STEX](https://www.stex.com) and other cryptocurrency exchanges.

---------------

This is provided by decentralized Ethereum blockchain. 
We provide only *exchange* service: fiat for virtual currency and vice-versa.
