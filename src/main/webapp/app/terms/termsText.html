    <h2>Due diligence and KYC</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of customer due diligence is to prevent the use of assets and property obtained
        in a criminal manner in the economic activities of credit institutions and financial
        institutions and in the services provided by them whose goal is to prevent the exploitation
        of the financial system and economic space of the Republic of Estonia for money laundering
        and terrorist financing. Customer due diligence is aimed, first and foremost, at applying
        the Know-Your-Customer principle, under which a customer shall be identified and the
        appropriateness of transactions shall be assessed based on the customer’s principal business
        and prior pattern of payments. In addition, customer due diligence serves to identify
        unusual circumstances in the operations of a customer or circumstances whereby an employee
        of the Company has reason to suspect money laundering or terrorist financing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Requirement for the measures of prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing is
        that the Company does not enter into transactions or establish relationships with anonymous
        or unidentified persons. Legislation requires that the Company waives a transaction or the
        establishment of a business relationship if a person fails to provide sufficient information
        to identify the person or about the purpose of the transactions or if the operations of the
        person involve a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. Also, legislation
        requires the Company to terminate a continuing contract without the advance notification
        term if the person fails to submit sufficient information for application of customer due
        diligence measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under current law the Company has the right, taking account the special requirements and
        restrictions provided by law, to use the services of a third party under a contract the
        subject of which is the continuing performance of activities and continued taking of steps
        required for the provision of (a) service(s) by the Company to its customers and that would
        normally be performed and taken by the Company itself. For the purposes of this section,
        third parties include, for instance, agents, subcontractors and other persons to whom the
        Company transfers the activities relating to the provision of the services provided as a
        rule by the Company in its economic activities.
